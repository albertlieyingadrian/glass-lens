# glasslens

A transparent, customizable recommendation stream built for people who like Instagram’s discovery—but not the black-box brain rot.

**glasslens** lets you see *why* something is recommended, tweak the knobs (topics, sources, weights, rules), and iterate your feed like a saved search: intentional, honest, and yours.

## Key ideas
- **Glass-box recommendations**: inspectable signals + explainable ranking
- **User-tunable**: sliders, rules, and filters you control
- **Authentic by design**: less engagement bait, more meaningful discovery
- **Search > scroll**: recommendations behave like editable queries, not slot machines
